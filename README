# Python RAG Tutorial Setup on Windows (WSL Debian)

This guide will walk you through setting up the Python RAG tutorial from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcqEUSNCn8I) on a **Windows machine using WSL (Debian)**.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** installed with a Debian image.
- Basic familiarity with the Linux command line.

## Step 1: Install WSL and Debian

1. Open PowerShell (as Administrator) and run:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install -d Debian
   ```
2. Follow the instructions to create a user and complete the setup.
3. Verify your WSL installation by running:
   ```sh
   wsl --list --verbose
   ```
4. If needed, refer to the official [WSL Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Step 2: Install pyenv (Python Version Manager)

1. Inside your WSL Debian terminal, install **pyenv** by following the official guide: [pyenv GitHub](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
2. Install dependencies required for Python builds:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install \
       build-essential \
       curl \
       libbz2-dev \
       libffi-dev \
       liblzma-dev \
       libncursesw5-dev \
       libreadline-dev \
       libsqlite3-dev \
       libssl-dev \
       libxml2-dev \
       libxmlsec1-dev \
       llvm \
       make \
       tk-dev \
       wget \
       xz-utils \
       zlib1g-dev
   ```

## Step 3: Install Python 3.13 and Virtual Environment

1. After installing **pyenv**, install Python 3.13:
   ```sh
   pyenv install 3.13
   ```
2. Ensure you have `pip` and `venv` installed:
   ```sh
   pyenv exec python -m ensurepip
   pyenv exec python -m venv venv313
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   source venv313/bin/activate
   ```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

1. Install required development tools:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
   ```
2. Install project dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install additional required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install "unstructured[pdf]"
   ```
   This may require additional system dependencies:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6 -y
   ```

## Step 5: Running the Project

1. Place a **PDF file** inside the `data/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python test.py
   ```

This setup was a challenge to get working, but now it's documented for an easier process next time. üéâ

# ü§ñ AI-Powered Assistant

**AI-Powered Assistant** is a custom-built AI tool designed to clone and automate the personality of a real estate influencer for social media content creation.  
Launched in **June 2024**, this assistant maintains high levels of personalized engagement at scale ‚Äî without sacrificing authenticity.

It is part of the **Artisan AI Suite**, a collection of intelligent tools for creators, entrepreneurs, and artists.

---

## üß† Overview

Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and fine-tuned local models, the AI-Powered Assistant:

- üìù **Generates Personalized Social Posts**  
  Customizes captions, replies, and promotional material with influencer-specific language and tone.

- üìà **Maintains Audience Engagement at Scale**  
  Supports consistent, authentic interaction without manual workload bottlenecks.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Uses Local AI Models**  
  Full control over data, style, and deployment ‚Äî no need for cloud-based APIs or external hosting.

- üéØ **Focuses on Brand Voice Consistency**  
  Trained and tuned specifically to replicate real-world influencer personas.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Personal branding material (social media posts, blogs, interviews) is collected into a training dataset.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning**  
   Fine-tunes a small language model to mirror the influencer‚Äôs style using a RAG-based training approach.

3. **Content Generation**  
   Users can input topics, prompts, or campaign goals, and the assistant generates text accordingly.

4. **Social Automation Integration**  
   Outputs can be scheduled directly into social media automation tools for streamlined posting.
